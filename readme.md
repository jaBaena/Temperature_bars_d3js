The goal of this project is creating bar graphs with gradient colors.

We will use the average temperature of Malaga for months during 2018 as data.

For this the only thing that we will have to do is to clone this repository, 
and after that execute the command "npm start" to use node (they must download it) 
and thus represent the graph in a localhost.

In addition I have left as an option to paint the X axis with ".scaletime ()",
 in case you need to use it or if you just prefer it that way instead of ".scaleband ()".
